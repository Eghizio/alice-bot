# Alice Bot
Say Hi to __*Alice*__, my Discord Bot.

Alice is my Discord Bot that I use on my personal Discord Server where I share a lot of interesting stuff and some memes ðŸ˜„

She is written in TypeScript using [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/)

As for now Alice doesn't have many features, but that will change in the future.
